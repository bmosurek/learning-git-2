        <h1>Paradise</h1>
        <h3>by Coldplay</h3>
            [Verse 1]
            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
            When she was just a girl
            She expected the world
            But it flew away from her reach
            So she ran away in her sleep

            [Chorus]
            And dreamed of para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Every time she closed her eyes

            [Verse 2]
            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
            When she was just a girl
            She expected the world
            But it flew away from her reach
            And the bullets catch in her teeth
            Life goes on, it gets so heavy
            The wheel breaks the butterfly
            Every tear, a waterfall
            In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
            In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

            [Chorus]
            And dream of para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
            She'd dream of para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Para-para-paradise
            Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
